# Contributing

Welcome to the ProtonDrive CLI Project. Here you will find some basic
information on how to contribute to the project.

## Reporting Bugs

## Submitting Changes

All changes should:
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
- Should pass local [pre-commit][] tests.
- Should be submitted as a pull-request to the repository.

## Testing

Local testing is handled by [pre-commit][], which will also be used to
automatically test any pull-requests in the repositories CI/CD pipeline.

See the [installation instructions](https://pre-commit.com/#install) for
[pre-commit][] for more details.
